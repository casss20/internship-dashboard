# Standard Answers for Common Internship Application Questions
# Anthony Casseus - Summer/Fall 2026 Internship Applications

## Tell me about yourself
I am a Computer Science junior at the University of Central Florida with a minor in Cyber Operations and a GPA of 3.0. I am an NIH-funded researcher with hands-on experience in biometric data analysis and statistical modeling. I have shipped 10+ projects spanning AI agents, cybersecurity tooling, and NLP pipelines. I am passionate about turning AI and security concepts into working tools -- from RAG assistants to live threat-hunting pipelines. I bring working demos to interviews and thrive in fast-paced, collaborative environments.

## Why do you want to work here?
I am drawn to [COMPANY] because of [SPECIFIC REASON -- product, mission, technology, culture]. Your work on [SPECIFIC PROJECT/TECHNOLOGY] aligns directly with my experience building [RELEVANT PROJECT]. I am particularly impressed by [SPECIFIC ACHIEVEMENT OR VALUE] and would welcome the opportunity to contribute to such impactful work while growing my skills in [RELEVANT AREA].

## Why should we hire you?
You should hire me because I bring a unique combination of AI/ML expertise and cybersecurity knowledge, backed by real-world project experience. At the NIH-funded INTREPID Research Program, I built standardized protocols that cut setup time by 30% and maintained 100% compliance across 40+ participants. I have shipped production-ready tools like my OWASP RAG Assistant (reducing compliance lookup from 20+ minutes to under 2 seconds) and Cyber Threat Hunter (real-time packet classification across 5+ protocols). I am a U.S. citizen, available for [Summer/Fall] 2026, and ready to contribute from day one.

## What are your strengths?
- **Rapid prototyping**: I ship working demos quickly -- my AI Career Mentor Agent went from concept to working prototype in under 2 weeks
- **Cross-domain expertise**: I bridge AI/ML and cybersecurity, understanding both the technical and security implications of AI systems
- **Data-driven approach**: My NIH research background trained me to validate everything with data -- I improved data alignment accuracy by 80% over manual workflows
- **Self-directed learning**: I taught myself LangChain, RAG pipelines, and AI security tooling to build projects that solve real problems

## What are your weaknesses?
I sometimes dive deep into technical details when presenting my work. I am working on tailoring my communication to the audience -- whether that is a technical deep-dive with engineers or a high-level summary for stakeholders. I have improved by practicing 30-second and 2-minute versions of my project pitches.

## Describe a challenging project and how you handled it
My OWASP RAG Assistant was challenging because security contexts demand high accuracy with verifiable sources. The problem: LLMs hallucinate, and in security, wrong answers are dangerous. My solution: I implemented source-traced retrieval using Pinecone vector store, ensuring every answer cites its source. I indexed 50+ OWASP documents and validated the system with 30+ peers. The result: compliance lookup time dropped from 20+ minutes to under 2 seconds, with every answer verifiable.

## Where do you see yourself in 5 years?
In 5 years, I see myself as a senior engineer leading AI/ML or security projects, ideally at the intersection of both. I want to be the person who can architect secure AI systems and mentor junior engineers. I am particularly interested in [COMPANY-SPECIFIC AREA] and hope to grow within an organization that values both technical excellence and ethical AI development.

## What is your expected salary?
I am primarily focused on finding a role where I can learn and contribute meaningfully. For [LOCATION] internships, I understand the market range is typically [RESEARCH RANGE]. I am open to discussing compensation that reflects the value I will bring and is competitive for the role and location.

## Are you legally authorized to work in the United States?
Yes, I am a U.S. citizen and fully authorized to work in the United States without sponsorship.

## When can you start?
I am available to start [DATE] for a [Summer/Fall] 2026 internship. My academic schedule is flexible, and I can accommodate start dates that align with your team's needs.

## Do you have any questions for us?
- What does success look like in this role after 30/60/90 days?
- What projects would I be working on, and what is the team composition?
- How does [COMPANY] approach mentorship for interns?
- What technologies does the team use day-to-day?
- Are there opportunities for full-time conversion after the internship?

## Describe your experience with [TECHNOLOGY]
Customize based on the specific technology:

**Python**: 4+ years of experience. Used for ETL pipelines, ML models (TensorFlow, PyTorch, scikit-learn), web scraping, and backend development. Built production-ready tools including packet sniffers, RAG assistants, and AI agents.

**Machine Learning/AI**: Hands-on experience with LangChain, RAG pipelines, LLM agents, TensorFlow, PyTorch, and NLP. Built and deployed models for emotion recognition (89% accuracy), sentiment analysis (84% accuracy), and real-time network traffic classification.

**Cybersecurity**: Experience with OWASP Top 10, penetration testing, threat detection, packet analysis (Scapy), and security tools (Burp Suite, Nmap, Metasploit). Active participant in CTF competitions and Hack UCF.

**Cloud/DevOps**: Experience with AWS Lambda, Docker, Prometheus, CI/CD pipelines, and Linux administration. Deployed containerized applications with monitoring and auto-scaling.

## Why did you choose Computer Science?
I chose Computer Science because I am fascinated by the power to build tools that solve real problems. My early experience automating workflows at Health 4 Haitians showed me how code can eliminate tedious manual work and free people to focus on what matters. Since then, I have been driven to create technology that is both powerful and secure -- especially at the intersection of AI and cybersecurity.

## Tell me about a time you worked in a team
At KnightHacks 2024, my team of 4 had 48 hours to ship a working project. I took the lead on backend architecture and API integration while coordinating with frontend and ML teammates. We faced a critical bug 6 hours before the deadline -- I debugged the issue, implemented a fix, and we placed in the top 20%. The experience taught me the value of clear communication, dividing work by strengths, and staying calm under pressure.

## How do you handle tight deadlines?
I break the project into milestones, prioritize the core functionality, and ship a working version first. For my AI Career Mentor Agent, I had a 2-week deadline. I scoped the MVP to 3 core features, built a working prototype by day 10, and used the remaining time for polish. I communicate progress daily and raise blockers early.

## What motivates you?
I am motivated by solving hard problems and seeing my code make a real impact. Whether it is cutting compliance lookup time from 20 minutes to 2 seconds or automating manual data processing, I love building tools that people actually use. I am also motivated by continuous learning -- every project teaches me something new.
