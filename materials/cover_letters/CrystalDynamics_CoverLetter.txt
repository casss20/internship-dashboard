Hiring Manager
Crystal Dynamics

Dear Hiring Manager,

I am writing to express my strong interest in the Cyber Security Intern position at Crystal Dynamics. As a Computer Science junior at the University of Central Florida with a minor in Cyber Operations and a passion for both gaming and security, I am excited about the opportunity to contribute to protecting the systems behind iconic gaming experiences.

What draws me to Crystal Dynamics is your legacy of creating groundbreaking games and your commitment to delivering secure, high-quality experiences to millions of players. Your work on the Tomb Raider franchise and Marvel's Avengers demonstrates the critical importance of robust security in modern gaming. I am particularly impressed by Crystal Dynamics' collaborative culture and would welcome the opportunity to contribute to your security team.

My background has prepared me well for this role. At the NIH-funded INTREPID Research Program, I maintained 100% compliance with UCF IRB and NIH protocols, enforcing anonymization and secure storage methods across all 40+ participants. I built the Cyber Threat Hunter, a live AI-powered packet sniffer for real-time threat detection, and actively compete in CTF challenges covering web exploitation and reverse engineering. These experiences have strengthened my skills in threat detection, secure system design, and incident response.

Technically, I bring hands-on experience with Python, Scapy, penetration testing tools, and AI-powered security systems. My projects include the OWASP RAG Assistant for security compliance and TATI - an AI Cybersecurity Assistant with prompt injection shields. I understand the unique security challenges facing the gaming industry, from protecting player data to preventing cheating and DDoS attacks.

I would welcome the opportunity to discuss how my skills and enthusiasm can contribute to the Cyber Security team at Crystal Dynamics. Thank you for considering my application. I look forward to hearing from you.

Sincerely,

Anthony Casseus
